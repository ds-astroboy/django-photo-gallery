### Create an album from the Django admin panel

Albums can be created from the Django admin panel where one zip file with all the images should be selected from the PC. The Django Photo Gallery will resize the images to improve the picute load times and will also create thumbnail for every image in the zip.

## Minimal Path to Awesome

- Clone this repository.
- Open the command line, navigate to the django app folder and execute:
    - `virtualenv env` (requires virtualenv)
    - Linux: `source env/bin/activate`, Windows: `call env/Scripts/activate.bat`
    - `pip install -r requirements.txt`
    - If the Pillow fail to install on Windows, then install it manually `pip install ../whl/Pillow-5.0.0-cp36-none-win32.whl` (if you are not using python 3.6 32 bit then  [download the Pillow wheel](http://www.lfd.uci.edu/~gohlke/pythonlibs/#pillow) for your python version).
    - `python manage.py runserver`
    - Open http://127.0.0.1:8000/ in web browser.
    - To access the admin forms go to http://127.0.0.1:8000/admin/ and enter user: admin, password: administrator

## Features

This Sample illustrates the following concepts on top of the Django Framework:

- Using django-material and materializecss for building Django UI.
- Using django-imagekit for building resizing images.
- Using photoswipe javascript library for more rich image gallery user experience.

## Control the image size and quality
The picture size and quality can be controlled programatically from the models.py. Just change the processors. For more information see [django-imagekit](https://github.com/matthewwithanm/django-imagekit).

```python
class AlbumImage(models.Model):
    image = ProcessedImageField(upload_to='albums', processors=[ResizeToFit(1280)], format='JPEG', options={'quality': 70})
    thumb = ProcessedImageField(upload_to='albums', processors=[ResizeToFit(300)], format='JPEG', options={'quality': 80})
    ...
```

## Sample data cleanup
To cleanup the sample data delete the sql lite database and the media folder files. Create new database and run the sample again.

## No validation on the form
This is sample. I decided to keep it simple and let the validation to be added by you.
